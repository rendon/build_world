# build world
Just a bunch of scripts and data files needed to build a database of continents, with countries and cities.

Some data files were ommited because of the file size, e.g. `data/world_cities.txt`, which you can get from [maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/free-world-cities-database").

So far the final DB is [data/ccc.json](https://github.com/rendon/build_world/blob/master/data/ccc.json).
